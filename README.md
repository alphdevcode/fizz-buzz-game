# Fizz Buzz Game

The main idea of this project is to integrate the Fizz-Buzz problem concept into a video game prototype. 

It is a wave system game where the player is in the center of the screen and the enemies are spawned around him. Enemies move towards the player to kill him.

Each enemy has a random number from 1 to 100 and based on that it can be a fizz (multiple of 3 but not 5), a buzz (multiple of 5 but not 3), a fizz-buzz (multiple of both, 3 and 5) or a 
dumb (not a multiple of 3 nor 5).

Conviniently the player have 4 types of attacks, which kills only one kind of enemy (dumb, fizz, buzz, fizz-buzz). In order to kill an enemy the player must choose the correct attack.
